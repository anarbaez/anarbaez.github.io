        The purpose of this report is to help identify possible website digital accessibility issues in order to prevent any access issues to this website via assistive technologies. The following accessibility checklist is based on the 
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/preliminary/">
            W3C WAI Easy Checks - A First Review of Web Accessibility

    <h2>Website Page Title:</h2>
    <p> 
        Your Website Page Titles are present for each sepeate page, Home, Abouts us, Services, Electronic Resources, Book Groups & Library Programs, and Catalog. This will allow for screen readers to relay which page users are currently on. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Results:
        As mentioned each page has a proper title to indicate whih page the user is within the overall webiste. 
        </p>
        <p>
           <h2>Image Text Alternatives:</h2> 
        </p>
        <p>
            There is a significant lack of image text alternatives or "alt text" throught the links on the library website. Without alt text, a user with a screen reader would not be able to get information on images, flyers to events or navigate through imaged based links.
        </p>
        <h2>Text:</h2>
        <p>On testing the text of the library webpages, there were multiple skipped heading levels along with headings with missing text. Also noted were multiple low contrast alerts between text and baground. This can make reading the information on the page difficult for lower vision users. 
            Upon further inspection, there are multiple empty links on the homepage and remaining conected webpages. Resizing the page caused majority of the information to become unreadable or visable. On the same fron, moving the page to a dual page screen also makes the site information unreadable. 
            Scrolling or swiping to the side of the webpage when in a zoomed or split screen mode also switches to a new page instead of scrolling the current page. This will also cause confusion for users.   
        </p>
        <h2>Interaction:</h2>
        <p>Keybaord access to the library website is not easily usable. Some users rely on only using a keyboard to navigate through a website and here it is not easy to know where you are on the page. When tabing through there is no indication of where a user is on the page.
            Highlighting or placing a box around text and links while tabing through assists patrons in knowing where they are in a page. Pressing the tab key also only takes you through the very top and very bottom links on the page and bypasses the library links all together. 
        </p>
        <h2>General:</h2>
        <p>Areas to focus on updating include: the addition of alt text for images, adjustment to the text colors used on each page to ensure readability, adjustment to ensure content is still accessable when zooming in on the page, addition of markers for keyboard only users to see which tabs they are on,
            ensure any links added are correct and working. 
        </p>
        <h2>In Summary</h2>
        <p>A check of features would be beneficial for your users. For the comments explained here, use of WAVE programing was how the initial check and sugessted for you as well. Following the inital check with this program, next have someone check through manually as well. This ensures the program does not miss 
            anything. Overall the information on the website is useful and interesting, steps simply need to be made to make all the great information you have accessable to all users.

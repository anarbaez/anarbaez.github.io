        The purpose of this report is to help identify possible website digital accessibility issues in order to prevent any access issues to this website via assistive technologies. The following accessibility checklist is based on the 
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/preliminary/">
            W3C WAI Easy Checks - A First Review of Web Accessibility
        </a>
    </p>
    <h2>Website Page Title:</h2>
    <p>In the web page markup, the <title> is within the <head> tag. Good page titles are particularly important for orientation, they help people know where they are and move between pages open in their browser tab. The first thing screen readers say when the user goes to a different web page is the page title. </p>
    <p> 
        Your Website Page Titles are present for each separate page, Home, Abouts us, Services, Electronic Resources, Book Groups & Library Programs, and Catalog. This will allow for screen readers to relay which page users are currently on. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Results:
        As mentioned, each page has a proper title to indicate whih page the user is within the overall webiste. However, on further testing there are not markers to indicate which tab a user is on. 
        </p>
        <p>
           <h2>Image Text Alternatives:</h2> 
        </p>
        <p>Image text alternatives ("alt text") (pictures, illustrations, charts, etc.) Text alternatives convey the purpose of an image, including pictures, illustrations, charts, etc. The alt attribute provides an alternative text for an image, if the user for some reason cannot view it. The reason can be a slow connection, an error with the image file, or if the user uses a screen reader.</p>
        <p>
            There is a significant lack of image text alternatives or "alt text" throughout the links on the library website. Without alt text, a user with a screen reader would not be able to get information on images, flyers to events or navigate through imaged based links.
            Example the images on the Home page directing patrons to the yearbook collection does not have alt text for what the image is showing. There are also flyers for events on the hompage without alt text. Patrons using screen readers would not know what these events are or where/when they are being held. 
        </p>
        <h2>Text:</h2>
        <p>Headings, Contrast Ratio ("color contrast") and Resizing Text should not only support visual aesthetics but also support the navigation and visibility of text content.</p>
        <p>On testing the text on the library webpages, there were multiple skipped heading levels along with headings with missing text. A webpage should have a single H1 heading followed by subheadings 2-6 as needed.Each of these subheading levels will distribute the page information in an organized and accessible fashion.
            Also noted were multiple low contrast alerts between text and background. This can make reading the information on the page difficult for lower vision users. 
            Upon further inspection, there are multiple empty links on the homepage and remaining connected webpages. Resizing the page caused majority of the information to become unreadable or visable. On the same fron, moving the page to a dual page screen also makes the site information unreadable. 
            Scrolling or swiping to the side of the webpage when in a zoomed or split screen mode also switches to a new page instead of scrolling the current page. This will also cause confusion for users.   (note: a webpage should be tested to a zoom level of 200% to ensure all information remains readable)
        </p>
        <h2>Interaction:</h2>
        <p>Many people cannot use a mouse and rely on a keyboard to interact with web pages. Keyboard focus should be clearly visible and should follow a logical order through the page elements. Visible keyboard focus could be a border or highlight.</p>
        <p>Keyboard access to the library website is not easily usable. Some users rely on only using a keyboard to navigate through a website. Using a keyboard on the library webpage soes not have any markers as to where you are on the page when tabbing through.
            Highlighting or placing a box around text and links while tabing through assists patrons in knowing where they are in a page. Pressing the tab key also only takes you through the very top and very bottom links on the page and bypasses the library links all together. 
        </p>
        <h2>General:</h2>
        <p>Areas to focus on updating include: the addition of alt text for images, adjustment to the text colors used on each page to ensure readability, adjustment to ensure content is still accessible when zooming in on the page, addition of markers for keyboard only users to see which tabs they are on,
            ensure any links added are correct and working. 
        </p>
        <h2>In Summary:</h2>
        <p>A check of features would be beneficial for your users. For the comments explained here, use of WAVE programing was how the initial check and suggested for you as well. Following the initial check with this program, next have someone check through manually as well. This ensures the program does not miss 
            anything. Add an aditional Main HTML tag as well for easy navigation back to the main page. Overall, the information on the website is useful and interesting, steps simply need to be made to make all the great information you have accessible to all users.
